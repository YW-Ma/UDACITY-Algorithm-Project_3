Efficieny:

    Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of item in the array
    Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of item in the array

Code Design:

    It's very similar to a quick sort.
    we already know that the mid value is 1.
    So all item smaller than 1 will be put on the left side,
    the item bigger than 1 will be put on the right side.
