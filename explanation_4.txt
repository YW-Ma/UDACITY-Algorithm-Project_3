Efficieny:

    Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of item in the array
                    There are N iteration and in each one
                    we need to determine which list the current item should be appended to.

    Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of item in the array
                    Storing each items in the input array.

Code Design:

    It's very similar to a quick sort.
    we already know that the mid value is 1.
    So all item smaller than 1 will be put on the left side,
    the item bigger than 1 will be put on the right side.
