Efficieny:
    Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the list of integers
    Space Complexity: auxiliary space is O(1)

Code Design:
    Update min and max values in each iteration.
    Make sure the initial value of min is big enough (I use sys.maxsize here),
    and the initial value of max is small enough (I use -sys.maxsize here).

    NOTICE: DO NOT set the initial value of max as 0 !!! 
            Because the input can be both positive and negative. (see test case #2)
